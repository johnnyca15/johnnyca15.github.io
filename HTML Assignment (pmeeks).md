Playing the bass for the group is Patrick. Taking up the mantle of Paul McCartney is a big task but having played guitar for 8 years, Patrick figures the bass can't be that different. Paul McCartney is known for singing on most of the Beatles' songs as well, which is another tall order, but that means getting to sing beautiful songs like "The Long and Winding Road". Patrick is excited to bring to the group Paul's charisma and fat bass lines as well as his beautiful singing.
