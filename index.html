  Courtney "Francourtney" Francoeur began drumming when she was only 3 months old. When she found frozen breadsticks in her family's kitchen and began to hit miscellaneous pots and pans with them. After this deliciously cacophonous incident. She has had a passion for the drum set. In her later school years, Courtney led her school's marching band by playing center snare on the drum line, where she was famous for breaking drumsticks and smashing snare heads. Now, Courtney has settled down and is a member of a Beatles cover band where she is like a 21st century reincarnation of Ringo Starr himself. Everyone's third favorite member of the Beatles. Courtney also aspires to be third favorite in the cover band, as nothing is worse than the pain of being in last or second place, because you're either the worst loser or the first loser. And she definitely doesn't want to be first favorite, because first is the worst... DUH!

  Playing the bass for the group is Patrick. Taking up the mantle of Paul McCartney is a big task but having played guitar for 8 years, Patrick figures the bass can't be that different. Paul McCartney is known for singing on most of the Beatles' songs as well, which is another tall order, but that means getting to sing beautiful songs like "The Long and Winding Road". Patrick is excited to bring to the group Paul's charisma and fat bass lines as well as his beautiful singing.
