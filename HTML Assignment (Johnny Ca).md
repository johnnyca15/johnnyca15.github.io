Johnny Ca (Keyboard)
Johnny lived in Chanhassen MN, 5 minutes away from Prince's studio. He always had a passion of music, especially creating covers of popular songs. Johnny's music education was originally started from playing classical piano, until he was tired of practicing. He then took some time off to play songs that he wanted to hear. After years of self-taught, he grew a passion for playing songs by The Beatles.

Courtney (Ringo)
Courtney "Francourtney" Francoeur began drumming when she was only 3 months old. When she found frozen breadsticks in her family's kitchen and began to hit miscellaneous pots and pans with them. After this deliciously cacophonous incident. She has had a passion for the drum set. In her later school years, Courtney led her school's marching band by playing center snare on the drum line, where she was famous for breaking drumsticks and smashing snare heads. Now, Courtney has settled down and is a member of a Beatles cover band where she is like a 21st century reincarnation of Ringo Starr himself. Everyone's third favorite member of the Beatles. Courtney also aspires to be third favorite in the cover band, as nothing is worse than the pain of being in last or second place, because you're either the worst loser or the first loser. And she definitely doesn't want to be first favorite, because first is the worst... DUH!
